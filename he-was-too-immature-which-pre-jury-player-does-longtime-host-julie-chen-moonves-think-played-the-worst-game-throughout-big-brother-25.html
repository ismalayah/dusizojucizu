<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Matt Klotz</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jag Bains</a>, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Brother 25</a></strong> has seen the good, the

yikes!</p><p data-characters=150 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>While the gameplay seen within Big Brother 25 has been lackluster (to say the least), which houseguests have played the best and worst games thus far?</p><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=614 data-injectable=true>In an <a href=#>exclusive interview with Entertainment Weekly</a>, longtime host Julie Chen Moonves spilled all of the tea when asked the question, “Which person among the folks who didn’t make it to the jury do you think played the best game?”</p><p data-characters=157 data-current-count=157 data-injectable=false>Keep scrolling to see who Julie named to be the best (and most importantly, the worst) pre-jury players on Big Brother 25 — her answers might surprise you!</p><img

data-characters=143 data-current-count=143 data-injectable=false>Despite being evicted early on in the season Julie believes that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hisam Goueli</a> was quite the competitor, although he did have quite a few flaws.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 data-characters=256 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>Julie shared, “He’s smart and he’s good, but he’s not humble and he doesn’t let anyone else talk. He was kind of like a team captain, but then he lost his team. He could have rallied, and he seemed good at competitions.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 data-characters=219 data-current-count=618 data-injectable=true>He’s smart, he’s physical, but he didn’t have the personality,” the longtime host continued, prior to diving into those who had games that were rather forgettable: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirsten Elwin</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mecole Hayes</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 data-characters=103 data-current-count=103 data-injectable=false>Julie spilled, “Kirsten, hard to judge her.&nbsp;Mecole, she just kind of floated through.”</p><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>With these three houseguests aside, in the eyes of Julie Chen Moonves, Reilly Smedley was another individual who had a great deal of potential (like Hisam), however, her journey was cut too short to tell.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 data-characters=371 data-current-count=679 data-injectable=true>“Reilly, maybe she could have been, but we didn’t get to see enough,” she explained. “I don’t think she could handle the pressure of the power. She could have been good at all the competitions, but handling the politics of the house and the pressure of the power of being HoH, I think she was a little bit too emotional for that role.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Jared-Fields-Big-Brother.png><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>While Julie deemed Hisam and Reilly as potentially the strongest pre-jury players, there is one individual who she said definitely did NOT have the best game: son of four-time <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Survivor</a> player <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cirie Fields</a>, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jared Fields</a></strong>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>“Not&nbsp;Jared,” Julie stated explicitly. “He was too immature and played too hard, too quickly, rushing through things and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">telling Blue about Cirie being his mom</a>. He just needed to grow up a little bit” — we seriously could not agree more!</p><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>While Julie Chen Moonves (as well as viewers back home) agree that <a href=#>Jared was messy and hot headed throughout Big Brother 25</a>, he has no regrets about his gameplay.</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>In another <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive interview with Entertainment Weekly</a> upon his exit, Jared revealed, “Everything that happened in my game made me into the player who I was, and I was happy and grateful to be that player, and I was content with the player that I was.”</p><p data-characters=82 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>If Jared himself is happy with his gameplay, that’s all that matters, right?</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=false>Nonetheless, tune into CBS or Paramount Plus for brand new episodes&nbsp;of&nbsp;Big Brother 25&nbsp;every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday to see how the remainder of the season plays out —&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with a double eviction on the horizon</a>, things are about to get crazy!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypsYywmKxlpKS8brXMppitraKaeri0yJyfZqiimnqrwdGyZKmkka6ys3nDqJysZZyku6jAyKacZqCfqMFuttSloJ5lk52yr3nMqKanrpWoerW0yKeiZqiclsamsIytn55lp6S%2FtMCMoJimnV2ptbO71KCfqK2kYq%2Bqs4ybqaismJq%2Fbn6UaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./notorious-twitter-shtposter-dril-mightve-predicted-elon-musks-takeover-almost-a-decade-ago.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Notorious Twitter sh*tposter Dril mightve predicted Elon Musks takeover almost a decade ago</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./wiltons-evan-reifert-making-most-of-opportunity-in-rays-organization.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Wiltons Evan Reifert Making Most of Opportunity in Rays Organization</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tom-lowell-net-worth.html>Tom Lowell Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anna-faith.html>Anna Faith is an Instagram model and cosplayer who has a net worth of $300,000.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./walker-scobell-career-earnings-salary-and-net-worth.html>Walker Scobell career earnings, salary and net worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximilian-dood-youtuber-wiki-bio-age-height-weight-girlfriend-net-worth-family-career-facts.html>Maximilian Dood (Youtuber) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Family, Career, Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kaaris-a-french-rapper-got-arrested-for-domestic-violation.html>Kaaris A French Rapper Got Arrested For Domestic Violation</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
