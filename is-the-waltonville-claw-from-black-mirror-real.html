As the Black Mirror universe often contains a blend of fictional characters and companies alongside ones that exist in our world, viewers might sometimes spot a reference to something that genuinely does have a real-life presence.</p><p data-characters=732 data-current-count=732 data-injectable=true>The second episode, titled ‚ÄúLoch Henry,‚Äù of the new season is an intriguing exploration of the dangers and damage caused by our increasingly global obsession with the true crime genre, driven home by one of the bleakest and most unsettling ending the show has ever given us. It follows Davis (Samuel Blenkin) and Pia (Myha‚Äôla Herrold), a young couple who are taking a trip back to the former‚Äôs idyllic rural Scottish hometown to make a nature documentary, only to change focus when Pia learns about a gruesome local serial killer case. The pair, alongside Davis‚Äô childhood friend Stuart (Daniel Portman), delve into the murders, only to unearth something even more disturbing than the original deaths.</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>During the course of the episode, there‚Äôs plenty of discussion of true crime documentaries, and one Netflix series gets mentioned as being particularly gruesome: The Waltonville Claw. However, is this a real show, or something made up by Charlie Brooker to make a point?</p><h2 id=h-is-the-waltonville-claw-a-real-true-crime-show data-injectable=false>Is The Waltonville Claw a real true crime show?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Charlie-Brooker-Black-Mirror.jpg><p data-characters=629 data-current-count=629 data-injectable=true>No, The Waltonville Claw isn‚Äôt a real <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">true crime show</a>, although the description that we get in the episode from Stuart makes it sound pretty titillating. During the scene where the fictional series is discussed, Stuart mentions how the killer ate a victim‚Äôs eye in front of her, while also going on about how it was filled with sweeping shots of gorgeous Waltonville, showing off the stunning scenery and thus bringing tourism back to the town. He believes a true crime documentary made by Pia, Davis, and himself could restore his own town‚Äôs faltering tourism industry, and save the pub he runs in the process.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Is Waltonville a real place?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Loch-Lomond.jpg><p data-characters=651 data-current-count=951 data-injectable=true>As gorgeous as it sounds, Waltonville is very much a fictional spot. So, pretty sad if you wanted to do some Black Mirror filming location hunting, but there is one silver lining ‚Äî at least there wasn‚Äôt ever a deranged killer eating women‚Äôs eyes in front of them. The village and loch in which this episode was filmed, however, does exist. ‚ÄúLoch Henry‚Äù is set by Loch Long, which is part of the Loch Lomond & The Trossachs National Park. Loch Lomond is the largest loch in Scotland by surface area, although Loch Ness has the most water (it contains more freshwater than all of the lakes and rivers in England and Wales).</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@charltonbrooker</a> you have to make The Waltonville Claw on Netflix, as we need to see it.</p>‚Äî B-Movie Hero üìΩ (@BMovie_Hero) <a href=#>June 17, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=626 data-injectable=true>The village the episode was filmed in is called Arrochar and is right by the gorgeous Argyll Forest, perfect for delightful nature walks. If you are planning a trip to Scotland and want to swing by, it‚Äôs around an hour from Glasgow, so easily accessible (if you don‚Äôt mind tiny, winding mountain roads, of course).</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Why is it on Netflix instead of Streamberry?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Netflix-Logo.jpg><p data-characters=605 data-current-count=905 data-injectable=true>One aspect of all of this that left a number of viewers confused was the fact that The Waltonville Claw was described as a ‚ÄúNetflix documentary.‚Äù Normally, this wouldn‚Äôt be too strange, especially considering Black Mirror has been produced by Netflix for multiple seasons now, but the in-universe streaming service is specifically mentioned as being called Streamberry. It‚Äôs a major plot point in the first episode of the season, too. So, there were a few fans online wondering why the true crime show about the man who eats eyes wasn‚Äôt on the in-universe streaming service.</p><p data-characters=541 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=false>Brooker is known for his fastidious writing and attention to detail, so it‚Äôs unlikely to have been a mistake. Some theorized it was to make a direct dig at Netflix for their almost endless true crime content library, especially in the shadow of their biggest recent hit in the genre, <a href=#>Monster: the Jeffrey Dahmer Story</a>. However, unless the writers reveal the answer, we‚Äôll never really know why they made this direct reference to the real-world streaming giant, instead of the one they had set up as the bad guy in their universe.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqv4ytn55lp5a5tbvNr6ClpJVisK2t1madq6edYq%2BtrcKkZKahoqe8s3nRnpilZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stefania-deriabina-wiki-age-biography-birthday-parents-height-instagram.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stefania Deriabina Wiki Age, Biography, Birthday, Parents, Height, Instagram</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-many-people-in-europe.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>How many people in europe</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tom-lowell-net-worth.html>Tom Lowell Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anna-faith.html>Anna Faith is an Instagram model and cosplayer who has a net worth of $300,000.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./walker-scobell-career-earnings-salary-and-net-worth.html>Walker Scobell career earnings, salary and net worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximilian-dood-youtuber-wiki-bio-age-height-weight-girlfriend-net-worth-family-career-facts.html>Maximilian Dood (Youtuber) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Family, Career, Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kaaris-a-french-rapper-got-arrested-for-domestic-violation.html>Kaaris A French Rapper Got Arrested For Domestic Violation</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
