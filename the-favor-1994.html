She hasn't seen him in 15 years, and in the meantime she's gotten married and had a child. But she still obsesses about him, and in her imagination he has grown up into an ideal man, a hunk who is also smart and tender.</p><p>The woman's name is Kathy (<a href=#>Harley </a><a href=#>Jane Kozak</a>), and she is bored with her marriage to Peter (<a href=#>Bill Pullman</a>). She's fascinated with the life of her old high school classmate Emily (<a href=#>Elizabeth McGovern</a>), who runs an art gallery and has a boyfriend named Elliott (<a href=#>Brad Pitt</a>) who's an artist, six or seven years younger. But now Emily and Elliott are on hiatus, and when Kathy learns that Emily is visiting their former hometown, she makes her promise to look up the old boyfriend.</p><p>And not just look him up. She must also sleep with him, if possible, and return with a full report, so that Kathy can find out how much she's been missing, all these long years. Emily returns with a glowing report about the rugged, handsome Tom (<a href=#>Ken Wahl</a>), who in a photograph looks like a cross between <a href=#>Tom Selleck</a> and Paul Bunyan.</p><p>Up until more or less this point in the movie, "The Favor" is smart and intriguing. The screenplay, by <a href=#>Sara Parriott</a> and <a href=#>Josann McGibbon</a>, has a good feel for female best-friend relationships, and the dialogue has life and edge to it. I was also pleasantly surprised by Elizabeth McGovern, who I hadn't seen in awhile, and who skirts the awkwardness of her role without avoiding the wit, until . . .</p><p>Well, until somebody decided to make a U-turn and turn a human comedy into a screwball comedy. Without revealing the (less than profound) plot secrets, I can say that Emily eventually finds it necessary to personally pay a visit to the handsome Tom. The screenplay supplies her with a good excuse for seeing him again - friendship and loyalty are involved - but once she gets on the plane, all of the movie's carefully-established issues and values are forgotten, and the movie turns into a farce involving comic arrivals, departures, and misunderstandings.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55llpbDsL6ManBybA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-dilla-in-bmf-season-2-meet-actress-erica-pinkett-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Dilla In BMF Season 2?
