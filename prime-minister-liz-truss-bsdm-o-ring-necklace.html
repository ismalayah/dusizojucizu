But for those who are so deep-rooted in the way of life, obviously, you can’t just wear a leather collar all the time, such as at your day job — whether that involves being the British prime minister.</p><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=555 data-injectable=true>So some submissives may opt to wear what’s known as a day collar, which is a subtle style of chain necklace with an O-ring in the middle, similar to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ring on a leather collar</a>.</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=209 data-injectable=false>And folks, this lady wears this very specific style of necklace all the time.
