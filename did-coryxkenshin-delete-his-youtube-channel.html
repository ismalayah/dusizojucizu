This self-made challenge was not the first time CoryxKenshin set himself a daunting task, but this time the 29-year-old intended to give himself disastrous parameters to keep himself in check.</p><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=232 data-injectable=false>The comments section on the video quickly filled with concerns from followers, and the video itself shot to the top of YouTube’s trending pile. But did CoryxKenshin really delete his channel? Here’s what you should know.</p><h2 id=h-why-didn-t-coryxkenshin-follow-through-on-his-promise-to-upload-resident-evil-village-dlc data-injectable=false>Why didn’t CoryxKenshin follow through on his promise to upload Resident Evil Village DLC?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/CoryxKenshin.jpg><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>Before committing the act of deleting his channel, CoryxKenshin told his followers he owed them an explanation. He took them on a car ride to a beautiful park and set up the camera at the edge of a lake where the sun glistened off the water behind him as he filled his viewers in on everything that’s happened in his life.</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=true>He explained that his mother’s nail salon caught on fire due to an LED malfunction (she is safe); he alluded to some financial hardships after having to step in for close family or friends (he did not elaborate which); and he expressed an overall sense of feeling unmotivated, which, combined with everything else, made the task of completing Village almost impossible.</p><p>“In this stage in my life I just really suck at keeping promises to my YouTube community. I don’t know why. A lot of stuff happened that wasn’t in my control, but I definitely — there’s no excuse at the end of the day. I definitely could have powered through what was going on and got the series uploaded like I said.”</p><p data-characters=573 data-current-count=929 data-injectable=true>CoryxKenshin’s regret was palpable as he apologized on camera, albeit with his quintessential sense of humor. Supportive comments piled up in the comments section, clearly indicating that an apology was not needed. Nevertheless, as promised, he returned to his filming studio and started the process of deleting his channel. Taking his followers through the painful final steps, he let his mouse hover over the “Delete channel” buttons for several seconds, then painstakingly entered his email address and finally clicked “Delete my content.”</p><h2 id=h-did-he-really-delete-his-youtube-channel data-injectable=false>Did he really delete his YouTube channel?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=692 data-injectable=true>There’s no point in keeping you hanging on the edge of your seat. The answer is no, CoryxKenshin did not delete his YouTube channel. After explaining to his followers why he wasn’t able to get the walkthrough done in time and giving a faux walkthrough of deleting his account, the 29-year-old juked everyone out by deleting his personal YouTube account, not his professional one.</p><p data-characters=103 data-current-count=103 data-injectable=false>“I said deleting my channel. I didn’t say which one,” he said through a fit of laughter.</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true>Promising the full upload of Village very soon, CoryxKenshin asked his followers for a bit of trust as he navigated this tricky time in his life. He assured them that he would focus all his efforts on getting Villiage up on his site as soon as possible, and then shift his attention to the Nov. 9 release of God of War Ragnarök.</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=178 data-injectable=false>Deal or no deal, Village or no Village, CoryxKenshin once again proved why he’s everybody’s favorite YouTuber who, even in difficult times, has a joke up his sleeve.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8pbXDZpqoqqmtuKa60qGgp2WUmrmmwMRmn6KrXa68tsDUm5xmm5iWu6%2Bxy2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-amanza-still-on-selling-sunset-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Amanza Still on Selling Sunset?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bruna-mascarenhas-wiki-sintonia-height-age-boyfriend-family-bio.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bruna Mascarenhas Wiki (Sintonia) Height, Age, Boyfriend, Family Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tom-lowell-net-worth.html>Tom Lowell Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anna-faith.html>Anna Faith is an Instagram model and cosplayer who has a net worth of $300,000.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./walker-scobell-career-earnings-salary-and-net-worth.html>Walker Scobell career earnings, salary and net worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximilian-dood-youtuber-wiki-bio-age-height-weight-girlfriend-net-worth-family-career-facts.html>Maximilian Dood (Youtuber) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Family, Career, Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kaaris-a-french-rapper-got-arrested-for-domestic-violation.html>Kaaris A French Rapper Got Arrested For Domestic Violation</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
