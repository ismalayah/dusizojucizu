But, The Brigade managed to keep their group to themselves while operating in the shadows en route to three of its members filling the final three seats.</p><p data-characters=34 data-current-count=34 data-injectable=false>So, who was a part of The Brigade?</p><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=490 data-injectable=true>The four-person alliance was formed on day 2 in the Head of Household (HoH) room. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hayden Moss</a>, a 24-year-old college student from Tempe, Arizona, was Big Brother 12’s first HoH, and three other men joined him in his private suite: Enzo, a 32-year-old insurance adjustor from Bayonne, New Jersey, David “Lane” Elenburg, a 24-year-old oil rig salesman from Decatur, Texas, and Matt Hoffman, a 32-year-old web designer from Elgin, Illinois.</p><p data-characters=119 data-current-count=119 data-injectable=false>The all-male squad was formed with Enzo as its de facto leader. “We’re The Brigade, bro,” Enzo said.</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>The charismatic New Jersey native also handed out codenames to each member. Enzo nicknamed Hayden “The Animal,” Lane was “The Beast,” Matt was “The Brains,” and Enzo reserved “The Meow Meow” for himself.</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=664 data-injectable=true>With themselves as the core four, they went on to branch out and create other close relationships. Hayden got close with Kristen Bitting, Matt formed a strong bond with Ragan Fox, and Lane built a friendship with Britney Haynes. While doing so, they kept The Brigade secret (for the most part).</p><p data-characters=136 data-current-count=136 data-injectable=false>In the first five weeks of Big Brother 12, The Brigade occupied the HoH room three times — Matt snagged the HoH key in weeks 3 and 5.</p><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=573 data-injectable=true>Week 7 was when The Brigade lost its first member. Enzo, Hayden, and Lane became suspicious of Matt and his allegiance, and Matt realized a week prior he was the odd man out of the squad. Matt and Lane were Brendon Villegas’ final nominations during week 6, and Enzo informed Matt that he’d evict him over Lane. As history has it, Matt secretly had the Diamond Power of Veto which he received by opening Pandora’s Box.</p><p data-characters=120 data-current-count=120 data-injectable=false>It allowed him to pull himself off the block. Kathy Hillis was nominated in his stead and was given her walking papers.</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>Well, when Britney won HoH in week 7 and Brendon earned the Power of Veto (PoV), Enzo and Matt found themselves as the final two nominees. The Brains was ultimately booted off to the jury via a unanimous vote.</p><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=618 data-injectable=true>Before Matt left, he confirmed Ragan’s suspicions that there was a secret alliance between the four of them. However, Ragan didn’t do much with the information and after Matt told The Brigade that Ragan was on to them, ending Ragan’s game became their biggest priority.</p><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=101 data-injectable=false>Ragan joined Matt in the jury house two weeks later and The Brigade’s secret was still intact.</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>Hayden won the week 9 HoH and PoV, and with only Enzo, Lane, and Britney in the house, they secured themselves in the final 3. Before sending her off to the jury, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">they revealed their alliance to Britney</a>, who was shocked. On day 67, Enzo cast the sole vote to evict and their mission of being the only houseguests residing in the house was complete.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>Continuing his competition run, Hayden then won the final HoH. Considering Enzo’s social game was revered, Hayden evicted The Meow Meow on finale night. Hayden and Lane then faced the jury of seven, and with a 4-3 vote, The Animal left the Big Brother house $500,000 richer.</p><p data-characters=186 data-current-count=467 data-injectable=true>Hayden’s competition wins were what put him over the top. All in all, he scored four HoHs to Lane’s one, and out of the two of them, Hayden was the only one to capture a PoV.</p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>Although Season 12 aired 13 years ago, The Brigade is as noteworthy as ever in the Big Brother world. Many times when an all-male alliance forms or is suspected, The Brigade is remembered. Season 25’s Cameron Hardin recently likened his alliance with two other men, Jagateshwar “Jag” Bains and Matt Klotz, to the iconic group.</p><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>And even if Big Brother runs for another 20 years, The Brigade’s dominance will always be something for future houseguests to consider while traversing the social strategy game.</p><h2 id=h-we-ve-seen-enzo-and-hayden-back-on-cbs-since-big-brother-12 data-injectable=false>We’ve seen Enzo and Hayden back on CBS since Big Brother 12</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=743 data-injectable=true>Although The Beast and The Brains haven’t been seen on CBS since Big Brother 12, Enzo and Hayden have come home to the network. Hayden competed on Survivor 27: Blood vs. Water in 2013, and he placed seventh overall. Although he didn’t cash another massive check, Hayden had one of the most solid plays of the season. When he was a target on day 32, he convinced a few other castaways to engage in a rock draw that left him immune.</p><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>Enzo was one of 16 cast members brought back for Big Brother 22 in 2020, the second iteration of All-Stars. Creating “The Root” with Big Brother 16 runner-up Cody Calafiore, the two contestants made it to finale night. Unfortunately for Enzo, his Big Brother campaign once again ended without the grand prize check — Cody received all nine jury votes and Enzo came in second.</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=761 data-injectable=true>Two years later, Enzo popped up on CBS’s spin-off of MTV’s flagship reality competition show, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Challenge</a>. Coined <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Challenge: USA</a>, Enzo battled alongside stars from several CBS shows, including other Big Brother houseguests. As usual, Enzo made it to the end of the game. But, he quit during the final challenge, placing fourth on the male’s side.</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=230 data-injectable=false>I had the opportunity to interview Enzo ahead of The Challenge: USA Season 1 (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">you can check out the full interview here</a>), and I asked him if he’d move back into the Big Brother house for a third time if CBS gave him a call.</p><p data-characters=123 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>Although he said he wanted to try his hands at Survivor, Enzo didn’t shoot down the idea of another Big Brother run.</p><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=748 data-injectable=true>“Being cooped up in that BB house, man, that s*** is torturous,” Enzo said. “But, to do it one more time, it definitely excites me because I got third and second place. So, to go in there one more time and then get a ‘W,’ get a win, that intrigues me. That definitely intrigues me. But, it’s definitely hard being in that house for almost three months.”</p><p data-characters=113 data-current-count=113 data-injectable=false>“I’m a legend now, but that puts me into immortality if I win it my third time,” he continued.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5mrpqrXZ67bsDHnmSbqpmcrqWxjKilZpqZnHqjvs6tn56qXZa7pXnWobBmr5Wnsm7Ax56wZqafqa6juMRo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cast-and-crew.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ayberk Pekcan movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./don-diablo-announces-debut-us-tour.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Don Diablo Announces Debut Headlining Tour Of The US</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tom-lowell-net-worth.html>Tom Lowell Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anna-faith.html>Anna Faith is an Instagram model and cosplayer who has a net worth of $300,000.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./walker-scobell-career-earnings-salary-and-net-worth.html>Walker Scobell career earnings, salary and net worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximilian-dood-youtuber-wiki-bio-age-height-weight-girlfriend-net-worth-family-career-facts.html>Maximilian Dood (Youtuber) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Family, Career, Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kaaris-a-french-rapper-got-arrested-for-domestic-violation.html>Kaaris A French Rapper Got Arrested For Domestic Violation</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
