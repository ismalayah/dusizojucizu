Beating The Bachelor himself by a long shot — with Joey letting out a large belch immediately after — the pair’s connection got worse and worse as the show progressed, with the 28-year-old ultimately making the decision to leave the show in episode 2.</p><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>Struggling with grief during the group date — where she was required to dress up as a bride — Lauren’s mind was consumed with thoughts of her father, who passed away just a few months prior to filming The Bachelor. The Pennsylvania native was seen struggling with the idea that her father would not be in attendance at her wedding, causing Lauren to not feel like her best self, ultimately causing her to quit the beloved competition series during the cocktail party that same day.</p><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=232 data-injectable=false>While there could have been a missed connection between Joey and Lauren due to her untimely exit, it looks like season 28 of The Bachelor will feature another self-elimination, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reality Steve</a> spoiling exactly who this woman is.</p><h2 id=h-lexi-young-will-self-eliminate-from-the-bachelor-season-28 data-injectable=false>Lexi Young will self-eliminate from The Bachelor season 28</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/The-Bachelor-Lexi.png><p data-characters=92 data-current-count=92 data-injectable=false>Ladies, gentlemen, and fans of The Bachelor franchise, we did not see this one coming…</p><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>Despite having a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one-on-one</a> date with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joey Graziadei</a> in episode 4 that was nothing short of spectacular — opening up about her battle with endometriosis and growing her connection with Joey deeper and deeper — it looks like digital strategist Lexi is not the perfect match (no pun intended) for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tennis professional</a> Joey after all, making the decision to self-eliminate from the beloved competition series sometime before the sixth rose ceremony.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>According to Reality Steve, “Apparently their timelines of marriage and kids didn’t align, so she left. I’m not sure exactly whose timeline is what. All I heard was this had to do with their timelines not meshing,” ultimately quitting the show prior to the rose ceremony in Montreal, Canada.</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true>Given that the Bachelor Nation encyclopedia mentioned kids, could her self-elimination have to do with her battle with endometriosis?

According to Reality Steve, it is certain to be a 10 out of 10!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlpJ2ybr%2FEnKannF2svK6tzWarqGWjmrmnecSloKahnpbBpnnFq6amZaSdsm6uwJyfnqSfp3q0scCspqdlYm16orLTnqlmpJGqv6a6jKGmpaSZo7Smvo4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./one-getting-schooled-nyt-crossword-answers-1168784.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>One getting schooled NYT Crossword Answers</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paolo-vitagliano-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-454278-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Paolo Vitagliano Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tom-lowell-net-worth.html>Tom Lowell Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anna-faith.html>Anna Faith is an Instagram model and cosplayer who has a net worth of $300,000.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./walker-scobell-career-earnings-salary-and-net-worth.html>Walker Scobell career earnings, salary and net worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximilian-dood-youtuber-wiki-bio-age-height-weight-girlfriend-net-worth-family-career-facts.html>Maximilian Dood (Youtuber) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Family, Career, Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kaaris-a-french-rapper-got-arrested-for-domestic-violation.html>Kaaris A French Rapper Got Arrested For Domestic Violation</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
