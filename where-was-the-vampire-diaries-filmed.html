This commercial success was aided by an avalanche of award nominations, especially from more teen-oriented organizations.</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=688 data-injectable=true>The show follows Elena (Nina Dobrev), an orphaned teen who lives in Mystic Falls, a town known for its supernatural history. She begins to fall in love with Stefan (Paul Wesley), unaware he’s actually a 161-year old vampire. Stefan’s brother Damon then comes back onto the scene, bringing with him both romantic and more dangerous, supernatural drama.</p><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=287 data-injectable=false>The series was so popular that it spawned a number of other shows, comics, and even novels. One of the things that is so loved about The Vampire Diaries is its amazing backdrops. But where are these beautiful, varied scenescapes? Read on to find out where The Vampire Diaries was filmed!</p><h2 id=h-where-was-the-vampire-diaries-filmed data-injectable=false>Where was The Vampire Diaries filmed?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Paul-Wesley-The-Vampire-Diares-.jpg><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>Funnily enough, there are two answers to this. The incredibly popular pilot was filmed in British Columbia, Canada, specifically Vancouver and areas around the city. One of the shots of Salvatore Boarding House was also filmed here at Foxglove Farm, which has appeared in a number of other films and television shows thanks to its beautiful architecture.</p><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=734 data-injectable=true>However, the rest of the series was actually filmed in Georgia, as the Southern U.S state has some excellent tax advantages for movie and television production. The show is mostly set in Covington, Georgia, which was transformed into Mystic Falls every time a new season was filmed. Other parts of Georgia also appear in the show, including locations in the Greater Atlanta area.</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>In Covington, there are lots of places from the show that fans can visit. This includes Mystic Cafe, Scoops, and Lockwood Mansion. The latter is filmed at two locations: Worthington Manor near Covington, and 2129 East Street, SE Covington. The older shots of Lockwood Mansion from flashback scenes can be found in real life at Twelve Oaks Bed & Breakfast, where you can even stay the night, if you want!</p><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=491 data-injectable=false>Other locations tend to be private property, so you can certainly get a glimpse of the places while walking around Covington, but it’s probably best not to get too close or snap a picture without permission. If you do want to capture some memories, then the Clocktower is public and in the center of Covington. And, if you’re willing to drive a little, then you can drive to Oxford College of Emory University in Oxford, Georgia, which stands in for Whitmore College in the show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMSrnGavkah6tbTEZq2apaCev6Z5w6KYq6GVqHqntcumnJ1n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./yes-south-parks-casa-bonita-is-a-real-restaurant-in-colorado-opening-date-renovation-costs-famous-owners-and-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Yes, South Parks Casa Bonita is a real restaurant in Colorado: Opening date, renovation costs,</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./scotty-sire-height-age-girlfriend-biography-wiki-net-worth-14125-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Scotty Sire Height, Age, Girlfriend, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tom-lowell-net-worth.html>Tom Lowell Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anna-faith.html>Anna Faith is an Instagram model and cosplayer who has a net worth of $300,000.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./walker-scobell-career-earnings-salary-and-net-worth.html>Walker Scobell career earnings, salary and net worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximilian-dood-youtuber-wiki-bio-age-height-weight-girlfriend-net-worth-family-career-facts.html>Maximilian Dood (Youtuber) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Family, Career, Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kaaris-a-french-rapper-got-arrested-for-domestic-violation.html>Kaaris A French Rapper Got Arrested For Domestic Violation</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
