The first event was held in Amsterdam, and a state-side event recently concluded after a three-day run between Oct. 7 and 9. It experienced a number of embarrassing issues, but one quickly beat its peers out as the most jaw-dropping thing to happen at the convention. A prominent Twitch and OnlyFans creator named <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Adriana Chechik</a> </strong>made an appearance on day three, leaping from an elevated platform into a pit of foam cubes. Soon, headlines about the injury she suffered were flooding the web.</p><h2 id=h-what-happened-to-adriana-chechik-at-twitchcon-2022 data-injectable=false>What happened to Adriana Chechik at TwitchCon 2022?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Adriana Chechik (<a href=#>@ChechikTv</a>) looks seriously hurt after jumping in the foampit. Looks like <a href=#>#TwitchCon</a> cheaped out on the padding and amount of foam. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/BRPSs1EKVI</a></p>— Clippy Chimp (@ClippyChimp) <a href=#>October 9, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Chechik’s</a> injury became an instant talking point online, after footage of the incident landed on the web and started making the rounds. A clip of Chechik’s jump into a pit of seemingly soft and malleable foam went instantly viral after it was uploaded to Twitter, and was soon followed by news that the streamer was seriously injured.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>The pit in question was part of Lenovo’s booth, and was reportedly arranged with far too little depth. The typical foam pit is at least six inches deep, with <a href=#>The American Gym</a> noting that many are up to eight inches deep. All that space is filled with a multitude of foam cubes, which are intended to catch and cradle those jumping into their midst.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true>The pit at TwitchCon was reportedly as shallow as two feet in some places, with the majority of the pit clocking in at around three feet deep. This is far too little to offer the necessary protection, a fact that was well proven when a number of participants injured themselves when trying to jump in.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=458 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true>None of the injuries sustained—which include a <a href=#>dislocated knee</a>, several <a href=#>back injuries</a>, and one potentially <a href=#>broken ankle</a>—quite match up to Chechik’s, however. The 30-year-old streamer checked in with her fans following the incident and informed them that she’d broken her back in two places. She announced the injury via Twitter, where she informed her followers that she’d need surgery to have a “meter rod” put into her back “for support.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Well, I broke my back in two places and am getting surgery to put a meter rod in for support today. Send your support. When it rains it pours and I am definitely feeling the rain right now.</p>— adriana chechik (@adrianachechik) <a href=#>October 9, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=562 data-injectable=true>The pit in question was shut down on several occasions during TwitchCon, but was never permanently closed. Twitch has yet to directly address the injuries sustained at its convention, but a Lenovo representative responded to a request for comment from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN</a>.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>“We are aware of the incidents of TwitchCon visitors who sustained injuries in the gladiator game soft foam pit at the Lenovo booth,” the statement reads. “Safety remains our top priority and we are working with event organizers to look into the incidents.”</p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=685 data-injectable=false>There’s no news yet on how Chechik, or any of the other injured attendees, plan to address their injuries. Everyone who participated in the pit was required to sign a waiver, but that doesn’t necessarily free TwitchCon and Lenovo from responsibility. If all else fails, the optics of contributing to the injury of so many—and then ignoring any responsibility—would seriously damage the optics of both businesses.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9ahmK1lmJa9sbHNnptmrJ9irqW%2ByJqlmmWTnbKktMikZJqsXanEqsDCoZqopl8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hart-of-dixie-cast-where-are-they-now.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hart of Dixie Cast: Where Are They Now?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tell-me-who-i-am-movie-review-2019.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tell Me Who I Am movie review (2019)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tom-lowell-net-worth.html>Tom Lowell Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anna-faith.html>Anna Faith is an Instagram model and cosplayer who has a net worth of $300,000.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./walker-scobell-career-earnings-salary-and-net-worth.html>Walker Scobell career earnings, salary and net worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximilian-dood-youtuber-wiki-bio-age-height-weight-girlfriend-net-worth-family-career-facts.html>Maximilian Dood (Youtuber) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Family, Career, Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kaaris-a-french-rapper-got-arrested-for-domestic-violation.html>Kaaris A French Rapper Got Arrested For Domestic Violation</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
