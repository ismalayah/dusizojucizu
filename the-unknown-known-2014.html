More than any film this reviewer has seen in ages, "The Unknown Known" richly rewards a second viewing. The first time through, it's all too easy to focus on the many issues Rumsfeld's verbal miasma obscures rather than reveals, and to fault Morris for not pressing and pinning down his subject more effectively. The second time, one can't help but reflect that these bafflements are what the film ends up being about, really, and that they may be a more worthy and fascinating subject than the officious man who generates them.</p><p>Morris certainly knows his film isn't going to give many viewers what they will be hoping to find in it. In the first part of "The Certainty of Donald Rumsfeld," a verbose but worthwhile four-part essay recently published in the New York Times, he notes, "When I first met Donald Rumsfeld in his offices in Washington, D.C., one of the things I said to him was that if we could provide an answer to the American public about why we went to war in Iraq, we would be rendering an important service. He agreed. Unfortunately, after having spent 33 hours over the course of a year interviewing Mr. Rumsfeld, I fear I know less about the origins of the Iraq war than when I started. A question presents itself: How could that be? How could I know<i> less</i> rather than more?"</p><p>Indeed, "Why were we in Iraq?" will be uppermost among the questions people carry into the film, and like Morris, many viewers may well come out with the weird feeling that they know less than when they went in. It is also possible to see in this a degree of failure on Morris' part, a sense that he might have channeled his inner Mike Wallace to fashion a more aggressively incisive interrogation of Rumsfeld.</p><p>Yet it's not as if Rumsfeld is deliberately stonewalling the filmmaker, at least in any conventional sense. You feel like he thinks he's being perfectly candid and forthcoming, or even better: all these zealously mined and minted words, all the trips to the Pentagon dictionary to nail down their meanings as precisely as possible, all the tens of thousands of memos he once spewed out and can now revisit at will – this colossal outpouring must add up to something of monumental significance and clarifying value, mustn't it?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lpaO4r7vWp2Skpp%2Bsu25%2Bj2pr</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-year-between-movie-review-2023.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Year Between movie review (2023)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meet-twitch-star-brucedropemoff-girlfriend-dana-on-instagram-dating-history-and-relationship-timeline-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Twitch Star BruceDropEmOff Girlfriend Dana On Instagram Dating History And Relationship Tim</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tom-lowell-net-worth.html>Tom Lowell Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anna-faith.html>Anna Faith is an Instagram model and cosplayer who has a net worth of $300,000.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./walker-scobell-career-earnings-salary-and-net-worth.html>Walker Scobell career earnings, salary and net worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximilian-dood-youtuber-wiki-bio-age-height-weight-girlfriend-net-worth-family-career-facts.html>Maximilian Dood (Youtuber) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Family, Career, Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kaaris-a-french-rapper-got-arrested-for-domestic-violation.html>Kaaris A French Rapper Got Arrested For Domestic Violation</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
