Howey, born on May 24, 1989, in Los Angeles, California, always knew he wanted to be an actor. The then-budding actress polished her acting chops at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts. Howey began her television career by making cameos on well-known shows shortly after graduating.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=571 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>While her early work on shows like&nbsp;90210&nbsp;(which she portrayed while studying at NYU) and&nbsp;Revenge&nbsp;garnered her some attention, her breakout role as Whitney Taylor in&nbsp;Twisted&nbsp;brought her widespread fame. After that, she continued to land recurring appearances on shows, including&nbsp;Hart of Dixie&nbsp;and&nbsp;I Live with Models. Then in 2017, Howey landed her first major role when she was cast as Kat on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Fox horror series&nbsp;The Exorcist</a>. She has since starred in the Netflix comedy&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ginny & Georgia</a>, adding to her increasing, impressive list of television credits.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>The show has garnered positive reviews from critics and audiences, taking Howey’s acting career to new heights. In addition to her work on television, Howey has appeared in several films. Her film credits include&nbsp;Horrible Bosses 2&nbsp;and&nbsp;XOXO.&nbsp;So, here are some of the best TV shows and movies Brianne Howey has appeared in, based on their popularity and critical acclaim.</p><h2 id=h-10-the-passage-2019 data-injectable=false>10.&nbsp;The Passage&nbsp;(2019)</h2><p data-characters=652 data-current-count=1047 data-injectable=true>While The Passage only lasted for one season, it was well-received by critics who praised the show for its performances. The show, which premiered on Fox in 2019, is a science fiction thriller based on Justin Cronin’s trilogy of novels—Brianne Howey stars as one of the show’s protagonists, Shauna Babcock. Before becoming a vampire (or “viral,” as they are called in the series), Shauna was a young woman with a rough past. Shauna had a troubled upbringing, complete with legal problems and physical abuse from her mother, culminating in her receiving a death sentence for the self-defense murder of her mother’s lover.</p><p data-characters=697 data-current-count=697 data-injectable=true>While on death row, Shauna becomes a test subject for Project NOAH. In this top-secret medical institution, researchers are experimenting with a deadly virus that might either end all diseases or wipe off all humanity. Shauna is infected with the virus throughout the experiment, transforming her into a vampire-like creature with superhuman strength and the ability to communicate telepathically with the other test participants. Shauna is a captivating&nbsp;character as, despite her newfound power, she still shows her humanity and experiences emotion. Howey’s portrayal of Shauna lends sympathy and relatability to a figure who could have been easily dismissed as a simple villain.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-9-twisted-2013-2014 data-injectable=false>9.&nbsp;Twisted&nbsp;(2013-2014)</h2><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>Brianne Howey played Whitney Taylor on the teen series&nbsp;Twisted. The show ran from 2013 to 2014 on ABC Family, now known as Freeform. The story follows Danny Desai, a charismatic adolescent who returns to his town after serving time in a juvenile detention center for killing his aunt when he was eleven. Howey’s portrayal of Whitney Taylor appears in the first half of the season.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=506 data-current-count=903 data-injectable=true>Characteristically independent, extroverted, and sometimes manipulative, Whitney Taylor is the daughter of Jack Taylor, a boat mechanic. Her relationship with her father is tumultuous, and she moves in with the Mastersons following an argument. Throughout her story arc, Whitney develops close ties with the show’s main characters and becomes engaged in several mysteries and conflicts. Reviews for&nbsp;Twisted&nbsp;were primarily positive, with critics praising the film’s excellent ensemble.</p><h2 id=h-8-time-trap-2017 data-injectable=false>8.&nbsp;Time Trap&nbsp;(2017)</h2><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true>Jackie, played by Brianne Howey, appears in the 2017 science-fiction&nbsp;Time Trap. Mark Dennis and Ben Foster’s film also features the acting talents of Cassidy Gifford, Olivia Draguicevich, Reiley McClendon, and Andrew Wilson and follows the story of a group of students who travel to a rural part of Texas in search of their missing professor. The group then stumbles into a weird cave.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=467 data-injectable=true>Strange and potentially harmful time and space distortion effects occur as the gang explores the cave. Jackie is among the students that study the cavern in quest of their absent teacher. They become stuck inside the cave and shortly realize that time moves slower for them than it does in the outside world. The film then follows the characters as they make futile attempts to escape while they fight for their lives and try to make sense of their bizarre situation.</p><h2 id=h-7-batwoman-2019-2020 data-injectable=false>7.&nbsp;Batwoman&nbsp;(2019-2020)</h2><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>In October 2019, The CW debuted the pilot episode of&nbsp;Batwoman, which would go on to air for three seasons and end on March 2, 2022, before being canceled on April 29. During Bruce Wayne’s absence, his vigilant cousin Kate Kane dons the Batsuit and becomes Batwoman in the first season. Ex-con Ryan Wilder takes on the role of Batwoman for seasons 2 and 3, with the series focusing on her efforts to keep Gotham City safe in her new capacity.</p><p data-characters=475 data-current-count=475 data-injectable=true>Brianne Howey played the recurring role of Reagan in the first season. Reagan is a bartender and a possible love interest for Kate Kane. She has a reputation for being independent, savvy, and down-to-earth. Kate finds solace in her relationship with Reagan, and their plotline nicely complements the series’ bigger crime-fighting plot. Their connection is a significant part of the first season, helping flesh out Kate’s personality outside her heroic role.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-6-xoxo-2016 data-injectable=false>6.&nbsp;XOXO&nbsp;(2016)</h2><p data-characters=547 data-current-count=547 data-injectable=true>The Netflix original drama film&nbsp;XOXO,&nbsp;directed by Christopher Louie and written by Louie and Dylan Meyer, premiered in 2016 and received mixed reviews from critics. In this coming-of-age story set in the realm of EDM and the millennial generation, Brianne Howey plays the role of Darla. XOXO is the largest electronic dance music event in the United States, and the film explores the lives of six random people whose paths cross for just one day there. They’re all struggling to get past their troubles and find some common ground.</p><p data-characters=497 data-current-count=497 data-injectable=true>Darla is one of the six individuals in this group. She’s a young woman who lives and breathes social media and is determined and, at times, manipulative. Throughout the film, Darla seeks a relationship with Graham Phillips’s character, a young DJ named Ethan, who is getting his big break at XOXO. Through&nbsp;her character, Darla, Howey delves into the intricacies of contemporary romance and the repercussions of our insatiable need to check our social media feeds constantly.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-5-dollface-2019-2022 data-injectable=false>5.

After being abandoned by her long-term partner, Jules (played by Kat Dennings) must face her imagination to re-enter the world of women. It’s a quest to reconnect with the female pals she abandoned while in a relationship. The bizarre comedy in the show highlights the ridiculous hurdles women must overcome to keep their friendships and get through life.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=738 data-current-count=738 data-injectable=true>One of the show’s most distinctive features is Jules’ relationship with the “Cat Lady” (Beth Grant), who acts as her mentor and guide through life and represents her internal conflict over being unmarried and her dread of being abandoned. In the tv series, Brianne Howey portrayed the role of Alison B. for a total of 7 episodes. Alison B. is one of Jules’ coworkers at Woöm, a health startup. Alison B.’s high propensity for self-motivation, productivity, and self-improvement is one of her defining characteristics. She is constantly working to develop her feminine qualities. Though well-intentioned, her approach occasionally comes across as preachy, and her perfectionist tendencies can be scary.</p><h2 id=h-4-plus-one-2019 data-injectable=false>4.&nbsp;Plus One&nbsp;(2019)</h2><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>The plot of Jeff Chan and Andrew Rhymer’s 2019 romantic comedy,&nbsp;Plus One, centers on two lifelong friends who have made a pact to be each other’s plus one at all of their mutual friends’ weddings.

Howey’s acting as Jess Ramsey contributes to the film’s warmth and relatability, while the film itself has been hailed for its unique take on the romantic comedy genre.
