We know with the trend of plastic surgery, a beach-ready body is only one quick surgery away. So who is actually getting high on their own supply of fitness and diet tips, and who is outsourcing their weight loss to the professionals?

Following the surgery she lost 100 pounds, although she revealed that it wasn’t the “all-encompassing fix” she expected.</p><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=134 data-injectable=false>In fact, in 2006 she had the procedure reversed, removing the band as some patients choose to do after their goal weight is achieved.</p><p data-characters=537 data-current-count=671 data-injectable=true>Recently Sharon reports trying the trending made-to-treat diabetes injection Ozempic for additional weight loss. Ozempic is meant to target the appetite center of the brain, making a person feel less hungry, however, it is known to have some wild side effects for those without diabetes, the condition it was created to treat. Sharon lost 30 pounds, but did report to<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> People</a> the injections made her feel sick for months.

She had the surgery, and successfully lost 85 pounds. Yet she is open about her journey with the procedure, saying it is not the “quick fix” people seem to think it is. “All it does is move you in the right direction” she reported to<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> People. </a>In fact, Osbourne revealed she did major prep work prior to the surgery as well, including abstaining from alcohol and attending therapy.</p><p data-characters=164 data-current-count=164 data-injectable=false>Unlike her mother, Kelly has not removed her band, as far as anyone knows, and continues to keep up her diet and exercise routine to ensure its ongoing efficiency.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Randy Jackson</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=464 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Randy Jackson (@randyjackson)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>Randy Jackson is by far one of the more outspoken celebrities about his weight loss journey. Dropping an impressive 114 pounds and keeping it off for 20 years and counting, the American Idol star is definitely a weight loss inspiration.</p><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=697 data-injectable=true>Jackson underwent his surgery in 2003, starting at 350 lbs at his heaviest, dropping 114 of those following the surgery. He reports similar results as other celebrities who underwent the procedure, immediate weight loss, followed by lots of work to maintain it. He reports having to make big adjustments to his lifestyle, diet, and mindset. He uses healthy eating and Pilates to keep up his trim physique and we have to say, at 65, he has never looked better!</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Paul Wall</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Paul Wall The Po Up Poet (@paulwallbaby)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true>Paul Wall is a well-known rapper from Texas, but what many might not know about him, is that he is a gastric sleeve success story. The rapper lost 100 pounds following his procedure and continues to keep it off to this day.</p><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>He reveals that his “wake up call” about his unhealthy weight was an actual call – from a VH1 show called Celebrity Fitness Club. They wanted him to be a contestant on their popular show that took celebrities and helped them lose weight. He decided after his doctor described him as “morbidly obese” that he would do the show and explore his options. He reveals he was over 300 pounds prior to the surgery, and lost 100 from it.</p><p data-characters=173 data-current-count=173 data-injectable=false>He is a big proponent of the surgery, claiming he “got his life back” as a result.

She reveals she was 240 lbs prior to the bypass and that the surgery “saved my life.” All in all, she dropped down to a healthy 176 lbs and not only regained her health, but her happiness. Although she – like many other celebrities – cautions that the surgery is not an immediate solution and that keeping the weight off takes time and effort.

She decided to undergo gastric bypass surgery, and within three years had lost 160 lbs! Although she was initially hesitant to admit her weight loss had been due to surgery, she ultimately came around to seeing the benefits of sharing her story.</p><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=777 data-injectable=true>The secrecy of the surgery caused problems for her career, though, as she was let go from The View in 2006, with Walters citing her discomfort at having to “lie” to the audience on a show that was supposed to be about authenticity. In the years that followed, Jones opened up about her initial hurt over the comments, but eventually saw how her desire for privacy around the surgery might have caused problems for her coworkers.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>Now, however, she is open about her weight loss journey and ultimate success.

She also noticed a difference in her ability to perform, her stamina, and her overall health and well-being.
