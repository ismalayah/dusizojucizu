The group has now surpassed 200,000 followers on the curator page and has over 80,000 members. So what’s their deal? Why has this company caused so much controversy, and are they at fault? Or is it a group of gamers on Steam taking issue with diversity?</p><h2 id=h-what-is-sweet-baby-inc data-injectable=false>What is Sweet Baby Inc?</h2><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true>First of all, it’s important to know exactly what Sweet Baby Inc does as a company, in order to understand what people’s problems are. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The company’s website</a> states that it “is a narrative development and consultation studio,” the people working there pretty much help game developers to be more diverse with characters, story, and writing. They’ve worked on some massive titles, including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>, Spider-Man 2, and God of War Ragnarök.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>They’ve also worked on some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">really bad games, such as Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>; now, if people were mad at Sweet Baby Inc for that, I could understand. To be fair, it’s not really the dialogue or characters that were the worst parts of that game, so you couldn’t even pin the blame on the company for that. So what exactly is making people so upset?</p><h2 id=h-what-did-sweet-baby-inc-do-wrong data-injectable=false>What did Sweet Baby Inc do wrong?</h2><p data-characters=667 data-current-count=1036 data-injectable=true>If it isn’t obvious by now, the company didn’t really do anything wrong. The issue people have with it is that it’s “forcing” diversity, which is apparently an issue for some. The “Sweet Baby Inc Detected” group appeared on Steam at the end of January, making comments that were definitely in violation of Steam’s code of conduct. A reporter from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kotaku</a> was able to infiltrate the group Discord, where they noted cases of casual sexism and some alt-right rhetoric. In the last couple of days, the creator has since gone on to delete posts on the Steam page after an influx of attention and mass reporting, which was encouraged by Sweet Baby employees.</p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>The group was first brought to the general public’s attention through Chris Kindred, an employee of Sweet Baby Inc, who attempted to get the curator page taken down, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Niche Gamer</a>. In hindsight, this was probably a bad idea, as it gave more attention to the group than it had ever had before, and its follower count ballooned as a result. Kindred also got her X account limited for incitement of harassment.</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>At this moment in time, the “Sweet Baby Inc Detected” page is still up on Steam, although most of the discussion threads have either been deleted or locked. It goes without saying, but I’ll say it anyway: Diversity isn’t ruining modern games — if a person can’t enjoy a game because the protagonist isn’t a white male, then that’s a reflection on them, not the game.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZoq6GdXajEprHTZpmamqlitq%2BvjJymp6yipMOmvtKyZJ6woKGuqrrEnWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./a-murder-in-the-park-2015.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A Murder in the Park movie review (2015)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jacob-batalon-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jacob Batalon Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tom-lowell-net-worth.html>Tom Lowell Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anna-faith.html>Anna Faith is an Instagram model and cosplayer who has a net worth of $300,000.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./walker-scobell-career-earnings-salary-and-net-worth.html>Walker Scobell career earnings, salary and net worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximilian-dood-youtuber-wiki-bio-age-height-weight-girlfriend-net-worth-family-career-facts.html>Maximilian Dood (Youtuber) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Family, Career, Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kaaris-a-french-rapper-got-arrested-for-domestic-violation.html>Kaaris A French Rapper Got Arrested For Domestic Violation</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVlog.
